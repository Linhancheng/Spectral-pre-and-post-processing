# Download the code and example data, and run directly
We have uploaded the example data to the Baidu SkyDrive and Google driver.<br>

Download at: Baidu SkyDrive or Google driver<br>
##1.Training your model

Run the file 'one-component-model.py'.The corresponding example data have been uploaded to the folder named 'augmented data'.\

##2.Predict mixture spectra data

Run the file 'DeepCID.py'.An example mixture data have been uploaded at Baidu SkyDrive (named 'mixture.npy', 'label.npy' and 'namedata.csv').Download the model and these example dataï¼ŒDeepCID can be reload and predict easily.
